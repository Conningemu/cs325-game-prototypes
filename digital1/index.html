<h2>Bouncy's Shooting Range</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Provide a never ending meaningless shooter. Theoretically it was originally going to be a precision shooter where the player must shoot specific parts to advance(as evidenced by the fact that the signpost does not break).
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Repetition is a thematic element that is strongly used.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Follows very similarly to the puzzle shooter games that are commonly found on mobile phones.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Preferably the player will be entertained by aiming at a target and shooting, similar to real life shooting ranges.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The game contains a core loop of the player character coming from the left and facing an enemy, then after the enemy has been beaten the character moves on to face the next character. Each character becoming more difficult than the last.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game mechanic that is available in the prototype is the major gameplay loop that the character goes through. He defeats one enemy and then moves on to the next enemy. Although the prototype's enemies do not currently get more difficult.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The game features sound effects that are all manipulated recorded voices. 
The game also features Bouncy the Cowboy an adorable character that is sure to bring smiles to children's faces. 
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The setting is the Wild West, the home of Bouncy the Cowboy. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
There will be no major story, a full version of the game would have increasingly difficult enemies for bouncy to face off against. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The demographic that the game is trying to reach is anyone who downloads free ios or android games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Very short. Play sessions should only last about a minute max. The full version would similarly take a short amount of time.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Spamming the shoot button is a very effective strategy.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All assets were created by me. Including sound and art. 

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Very closely resembles ios and android "room" games. Where the player must kill the enemies in a room before moving onwards
