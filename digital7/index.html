<h2>Hamster Pipes</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Help the poor hamster sort out the pipes to go through.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Simple puzzle to help you relax
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Follows very similarly to the puzzle games already like this
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Preferably the player will be relaxed clicking on the pipes to make them match up
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The game play is simply click on each tile to rotate them until the line up from start to finish.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game mechanic that is available in the prototype is the major gameplay loop that the player goes through. This is used to show the concept of rotating the pipes.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The game features colorful pipes with a strong aesthetic. (except for the surrounding art)
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The setting is a backyard as seen by the green representing grass.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
There will be no major story, a full version of the game would have increasingly difficult puzzles.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The demographic that the game is trying to reach is anyone who downloads free ios or android games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Very short. Play sessions should only last about a minute max. The full version would similarly take a short amount of time.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
clicking randomly is an effective strategy
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All assets were created by me.

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Very closely resembles ios and android puzzle games, where they simple tap to rotate the pipes
