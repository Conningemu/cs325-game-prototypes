<h2>Stealth Tetris</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Get to the light at the end of the level without it seeing you.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Stealth and problem solving
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
similar to most stealth games except you can only hide amongst similar pieces
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player should advance slowly towards the goal, although this particular iteration is not very difficult it shows the idea behind the game. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Use the arrows keys to move around, when overlapped with your own piece you can become invisible by pressing the down key.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game mechanic that is available in the prototype is the major gameplay loop that the player goes through. This is used to show the concept of moving and going invisible.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The game features colorful tetris pieces with a strong aesthetic. (except for the surrounding art)
NEATO STEALTH MECHANICS
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The setting is something... Honestly I don't know. I'm just showing you the mechanics.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
There will be no major story, a full version of the game would have increasingly difficult puzzles.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The demographic that the game is trying to reach is anyone who likes stealth.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Very short. Play sessions should only last about a minute max. The full version would similarly take a short amount of time per level.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
clicking randomly is an effective strategy
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All assets were created by me.
