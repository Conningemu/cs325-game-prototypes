<h2>Your game title</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>Preservation:</strong>
Card game that is similar to Gwent. 
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
No story themes because it's just a card game.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Uses on screen "buttons",
Very random dependent on your draw
Card game
Competitor because people who want to win would play.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want it to be a skill orientated strategy game 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Currently the player can only play the card that he wants from his hand and have the AI play the card that they want. Combat system currently has a major bug THAT IVE SPENT HOURS ON AND I CAN'T FIX.
The actually game involves picking one card to play per turn in a kind of rock paper scissors system. Sword beats catapult. Catapult beats bow. Bow beats sword. Although it's not visible from playing it the way the advantages works in combat is that the strength is double against cards in which that card has an advantage. And vs cards they are weak to, 0.5. That is actually implemented but its difficult to show because i ran out of time to do animations. The strength of the card is tied directly to their health. If a card survives a battle, it comes out much weaker. I.E. A 4 health catapult attacking a 2 health catapult, kills the 2 health catapult and turns the 4 health into a 2 health catapult.
