<h2>Revenge of the Birds</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Rack up points as you poop on people's heads, try not to get hit
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Revenge is a common theme that motivates characters
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The game is esentially a platformer in which you can also glide.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the players to start off playing safely but eventually make a mistake and have one of the enemies to drop on top of them.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The final idea for the game is to have multiple levels in which the player must poop on all sorts of different peole. In a final version of the game it would not be as easy to climb up and glide down, requiring more platforming than this demo. possibly with different enemy types.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The glide mechanic and the poop mechanic are the two being tested in the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Most games do not have you playing as a bird.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
In a world where Humans rule the world, one brave chicken decides he's had enough of his Human overlords. Join him as he takes on as many sad humans as he can handle.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
No story. just a fun puzzle game/ endless survival. depending on how its developed.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone who's frustrated.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Depends on how good you are.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Sitting in the same spot and waiting.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made it all from scratch
